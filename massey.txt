Dear  Shengxin,

You are enrolled in the course 158.256 Web Applicaton Design.

For this paper have been given access to a blank SFS website where you will be publishing web pages and web sites that you will be creating in Tutorials and the Web Application Design Project. 

Below you find your password for accessing your web site using SSH and SCP clients such as FileZilla and WinSCP or you could just use the web-based file manager interface at https://sfs-webdev.massey.ac.nz:20000/.

Please note that this password does not replace the password you use to access Massey University services (such as Stream or MyMassey).

Your webspace is contained in a folder named "web". You must upload your website into this folder under appropriate sub-folders. Any file outside this folder is not part of the website.

You will also be given a database account (database host server, username, password and database name) for your website. The database could also be accessed and managed via its web-based interface at https://sfs-webdev.massey.ac.nz:20000/. Note that your website is accessible globally but does not use www.

Should you have questions please contact the systems administrator (M.Codeniera@massey.ac.nz).


For further explanation please see the Stream site for 158.256.
